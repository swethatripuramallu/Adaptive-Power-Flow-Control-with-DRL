# Adaptive-Power-Flow-Control-with-DRL

This project develops an **Optimal Power Flow (OPF)** solution for a distribution network with renewable resources and stochastic loads using **Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL)**. The primary goal is to minimize power loss while maintaining system constraints. The project evaluates the performance of DRL-based controllers compared to traditional methods, enabling efficient, real-time control.
