# Adaptive-Power-Flow-Control-with-DRL
This project develops an optimal power flow (OPF) solution for a distribution network with renewable resources and stochastic loads using deep reinforcement learning (DRL). Aiming to minimize power loss and maintain system constraints, it compares DRL-based controllers to traditional methods for efficient, real-time control.
